Api for my Trello clone. Made in Laravel by myself.

Having separate frontend and backend servers is a nightmare. All of my problems could have been avoided if I would just host all on one server. No annoying api tokens.
Yeah, it's possible. But the amount of extra work to set it up so just too much.
If I would have just used Laravel with Vue, it would be so much simpler and the result would be the same (same with only Nuxt).

Turns out hosting Laravel is not an easy task. So many settings. I have set my env variable to a wrong url and spent days figuring out why it won't work. Maybe if I would just pay closer attention to the documentation, it could save me a lot of time. At least I have learnt about Vapor in the process. It's like Vercel but for Laravel. Main problem with it is just the super limited free tier. But for production, if you are fine with serverless, it could be nice.
