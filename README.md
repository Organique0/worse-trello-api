Api for my Trello clone. Made in Laravel by myself.

Turns out hosting Laravel is not an easy task. So many settings. I have set my env variable to a wrong url and spent days figuring out why it won't work. Maybe if I would just pay closer attention to the documentation, it could save me a lot of time. At least I have learnt about Vapor in the process. It's like Vercel but for Laravel. Main problem with it is just the super limited free tier. But for production, if you are fine with serverless, it could be nice.
